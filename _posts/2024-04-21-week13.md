## Cathedral and the Bazaar

Knowing my own nature, if I were a software developer in the 80s and early 90s I would've certainly subscribed to the Cathedral approach. The thought of meticulously approaching a problem and creating bug-free, efficient, near-perfect code (while in practice impossible) is far more inticing than releasing early and often. Yet as Raymond puts it, upon further inspection the Bazaar style works, and most importanly, for a reason. Gathering an army of self-selected and self-motivated developers where bug finders and bug fixers intersect inevitably gets things done. In other words and as Raymond said: "Debugging is Parallelizable". I enjoyed being able to talk about the effects of Linus's at the time new approach to software development and it was interesting to hear from my peers their unique perspectives and intersts. It reminded me all the more that everyone has a unique skillset that's ready to match a problem.

## Bitwarden 

Contributing to Bitwarden has become slightly more complicated recently. We haven't gotten a response to an issue I suubmitted a few weeks ago and have decided to move along with trying to fix the documentation error we found. Recent issues have been more tech-supporty these days and it's definitely difficult to find a real issue to contribute to.
