## Presentation(s)

I have to say I'm extremely content with our presentation. Being the first team to present freed me of some anxiety I would've had had we presented later. In my previous post, I mentioned that I believe we prepared well and our slidedeck was solid. In the end, I think we were able to organzie our ideas well and our information was concise. We may have not had the best visual presentation but that probably wasn't any of our strengths to begin with.

Serious props to the other teams that presented. Everyone in the class contributed to interesting and meaningful projects. I was extremely impressed with our class's ability to contribute to OSS in such a short time span. I know how difficult our experience was at times, so once again I cannot understate how impressed I am. I learned a lot from the presentations themselves, and I know that I have to step up the visual component of my presentations going forward. Hopefully, I might be able to contribute to one of the projects one of the teams presented on in the future.
