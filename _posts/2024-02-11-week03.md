## Git

This week's Git exercise was a nice refresher on some basic Git functions I've lazily let the VScode GUI handle for soem time now. I suppose the exercise revealed I'm by no means a Git pro. However, after some debugging concerning merge conflicts I was able to finish the exercise in a reasonable amount of time. Being able to work it out together in a group added another layer of fun too. I usually program alone so working through the problem together was pretty refreshing. 

I think the group work later added to this experience as well. Even when I've done group work for my classes it's typically been exclusively online without any in-person interaction. Again, being able to work through the browser extension exercise with a small group made it easy and fairly fun. I'm lucky enough to be in a great group, so all of our work has been completed timely and without much hassle. Overall, my experience this week has been super positive.
