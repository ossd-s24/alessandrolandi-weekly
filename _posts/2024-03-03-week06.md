## Picking a Project

Picking a project has been quite the endeavor. It's difficult to find something that has open, beginner-friendly issues and is active enough for our class. I had been truly excited at the prosepct to contirbuting to [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), and [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed), but I severely lack the skills to contribubte to their newbie-labeled tagged issues. [OpenMl](https://github.com/openml/OpenML) uses a stack I have a lot of experience in, but rarely sees any updates or discussion. I've looked at many more and they tend to fall along these lines.

Thanfully, my friend introduced me to [Nuclear](https://github.com/nukeop/nuclear) which is an Open-Source free music streaming platform. The issues label is, to my surprise, full of doable issues that get responded to quickly. The development environment is incredibly simple too. The only challenge I can forsee is actually creating and contributing acceptable code. Realistically, however, there are challenges ahead I'm not quite aware of yet.
