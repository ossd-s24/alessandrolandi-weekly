## WebPad

This week my team completed and presented our web extension [WebPad](https://github.com/ossd-s24/WebPad/). Truthfully, I thought our group worked fairly well together, as we all completed our work without any real need to constantly follow-up or push for timely delivery. We were all able to divide the work needed to be done seamlessly and simply complete it. For the most part, I ended up doing most of Part 3 and 4 with some input and quality assurance before pushing it to the Course Wiki. For me this was fairly straight-forward, and I was glad to get the busy work out of the way.

 After presenting, I ended up pushing to change the license, since during the presentation the professor revealed that the Creative Commons license which I suppose we might've defaulted to wasn't suitable for software. We decided to switch to the Mozilla license, as it made the most sense for a FireFox extension (and if we chose to put it on the FireFox Marketplace). During the presentation, I surprisingly found myself interacting with the class more than I thought I would, facilitating questions, and demo-ing WebPad for the class. I wouldn't say I'm the best people-person, however I do find myself being the first in a group to try and reach out and make things interactive. All in all, WebPad was a fun experience and I'm glad to have shared it with my group.
