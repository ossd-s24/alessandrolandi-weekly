## Bitwarden-- Final Update(?)

This week has been a rough one it terms of contributing output to Bitwarden. Over the past two week we've been working on a bigger documentation change that we believed we could take the intiative on. I had submitted an issue just to communicate that it was something we as a team were interested in doing. Unfortunately, the devs got back to us basically as we were ready to submit a pr. They informed us that the technology wasn't deprecated but in fact was something they were planning to push in place of the old one-- they had jumped the gun without informing the community. Since that was our last big push to submit another contribution it was unfortunate that our efforts to contribute before the presentations ended on a sad note.

In better news, our slide deck for our presentation is finished and we're confident in our ability to present what we've been able to do over the course of the semester. Our team was able to coordinate this last task pretty effectively our responsibilities outside of this class. We're the first to present so it's nice to be prepared ahead of the date.
