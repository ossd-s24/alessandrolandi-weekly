## Bitwarden

My group and I decided that we wanted to contribute to [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden). The community is extremely friendly and they respond to issues and pull requests incredibly fast too. The repo is sort of complex but we all have relative experience with the languages that they use so learning curve isn't that steep. In their contributing docs, they have a useful repo architecure guide that walks contributors through the basic structure. So far, setting up the development environment and signing the contributor agreemeent has been relatively easy.

Since Bitwarden serves so many different architectures, operating systems, and different use cases, the issues tab is full of niche, edge-case type technical issues users are having. Of course, they have a few issues labeled as a "good-first-issue" that might be promising. Thankfully, but somewhat to our disadvantage, there are many contributors actively working to trim the issues page. Finding help is simple, but claiming/solving an issue has to be done promptly. Realisitcally, I think Bitwarden was our best choice in an Open Source project that would help us grow as developers.
